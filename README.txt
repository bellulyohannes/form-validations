This set of files essentially gets input from the user then presses login and depending on if the user’s input length is greater than 0, the input box will turn green but if the user’s input length is 0, it signifies nothing was inputted and will turn red. If the user chooses to reset the form, everything will be cleared. 


Something important to note: For me to send my work I needed to send my CSS files in .txt format because it would not let me send it. So for my HW4.txt file, you can convert it to a .css file and it all should work perfectly fine.
